//For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program,
//they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms,
//like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random,
//the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. 
//Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.
